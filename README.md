# .vimrc

This is my main [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) configuration.

 - It supports mouse input, but I recommend you fully learn the Vim keybinds in order to get the full experience.
 - Git integration
 - Mainly for python

### Requirements
This requires [Universal Ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags) to have working tags.
